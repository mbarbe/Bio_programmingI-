### Script description
  * `read_data.py`  reads data;
  * `getcox.py` is to calculate the cox-score of each gene when the dataset is given; also report the histogram of the cox-         scores of genes;
  * `f.py` will get the cox-regression result in the test dataset, while the PCA model is built on train dataset with the         qualified genes; those genes have cox-score > or equal than the given threshold
